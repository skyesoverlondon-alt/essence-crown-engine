Essence Crown – Core Rules v2

(KL = Energy, Essence = Life, God Charges = Divine Overdrive)

0. Plain-Language Core Ideas

Essence = your Deity’s life total. If it hits 0, you lose.

KL (Kundalini Level) = your energy / mana each turn. You spend KL to play almost all cards.

13 KL (“God Threshold”) = the special level where your Deity’s power “awakens”.

The first time each turn your KL reaches 13 or more (from 12 or less), you gain 1 God Charge (up to a max of 3).

31 KL (“Absolute KL Cap”) = the hard maximum for your KL.

Your KL can never go above 31. If an effect would push it higher, you stay at 31 instead.

God Charges = stored divine power on your Deity.

You gain them when you cross 13 KL or via card effects.

You can never hold more than 3 God Charges.

You cannot spend any God Charges until after turn 3 of the game.

Everything else in these rules explains how that plays out.

1. Components

A game of Essence Crown uses:

1 Deity card per player

Domain cards

A Veiled Deck (main deck) for each player

Card types in the Veiled Deck:

Shards

Avatars

Spells (Aspect Spells)

Rites

Relics

Support / Companion

Essence / Resource cards (if your set includes them)

Tokens / Echo Avatars for generated units

Trackers:

Essence tracker (dial, dice, or printed track)

KL tracker (0–31)

God Charge tracker (0–3)

Optional: turn counter

2. Core Resources
2.1 Essence – Life Force

Your Deity has a printed Essence value (for example, 23).

This is your life total.

If your Essence is ever 0 or less, you lose the game.

Essence changes through:

Damage
“Deal 3 Essence damage to a Deity” → that Deity’s controller loses 3 Essence.

Loss
“You lose 2 Essence” → you simply subtract 2 Essence.

Healing
“Heal 4 Essence to your Deity” → you add 4 Essence (up to any format-defined max, if one exists).

Essence as a Cost

Essence is not your main resource; you only pay Essence when a card specifically says so, for example:

“As an additional cost to cast this spell, pay 3 Essence.”

“You may pay up to 5 Essence; this spell deals that much extra damage.”

Paying Essence reduces your life total, so it is powerful but risky.

2.2 KL – Kundalini Level (Energy)

KL is the primary energy used to play cards.

A card’s printed Cost is a KL cost, unless the text adds an Essence cost or some other resource.

Every turn, in your Start Phase, you recalculate your current KL for that turn.

You then spend that KL throughout the turn to play cards and activate abilities.

2.2.1 KL Sources

Each turn, your KL is derived from:

Your Deity’s Base KL

The number of Shards you control

Static bonuses from:

Domain cards

Relics / Support cards

Passive Deity abilities

Start-of-turn KL effects
(e.g., “At the start of your turn, gain +1 KL this turn.”)

Default KL formula:

KL_new = Base KL
       + number of Shards you control
       + static KL bonuses (Domain / Relics / Deity, etc.)
       + start-of-turn KL effects
       (then capped at 31)


This recalculation happens once each turn, during your Start Phase.

After you calculate KL for the turn, that value is your KL pool that you spend from.

2.2.2 Absolute KL Cap – 31

Your current KL can never exceed 31.

If the formula or an effect would give you more than 31, your KL becomes 31 instead.

The board’s KL track should run from 0 → 31 with 13 and 31 clearly marked.

2.2.3 Spending KL

When you play a card or activate an ability with a KL cost, you subtract that cost from your current KL.

Example: you have 10 KL; you cast a Spell that costs 4 KL → your KL becomes 6.

You cannot pay a KL cost that is higher than your current KL.

At the end of your turn, any unused KL is discarded; next turn you will recalculate a fresh KL value in the Start Phase.

2.3 God Charges – Divine Overdrive

God Charges are special counters stored on your Deity, separate from KL and Essence.

2.3.1 God Charge Limits

You can have between 0 and 3 God Charges.

If an effect would give you a 4th God Charge, you stay at 3 instead.

Represent them with tokens or markers placed on or near your Deity.

2.3.2 Gaining God Charges – God Threshold (13 KL)

God Threshold = 13 KL.

Rules:

The first time each turn your KL goes from 12 or less to 13 or more, you gain 1 God Charge, if you have fewer than 3.

This can happen:

During Start Phase, when you recalculate KL for the turn and it becomes 13 or higher.

Later in the turn, if an effect increases your KL above the threshold for the first time that turn.

Important details:

You track whether the Threshold has already triggered for you this turn.

If at any point in a turn:

Your KL was 12 or lower earlier this turn, and

It becomes 13 or higher, and

You have not yet gained a God Charge from the Threshold this turn,
→ you gain 1 God Charge (up to a max of 3).

You can only get 1 God Charge per turn from the 13-KL Threshold, but you may get additional God Charges from card abilities in the same turn.

2.3.3 Other Ways to Gain God Charges

Some card examples:

“Gain 1 God Charge.”

“If you control a Void Deity, gain 1 God Charge.”

These abilities grant God Charges directly, still respecting the maximum of 3.

2.3.4 Spending God Charges – After Turn 3

You cannot spend or apply God Charges during turns 1–3 of the game.

You may gain God Charges during those early turns; they’re just locked until later.

In a 2-player game:

Turn 1 = Player A

Turn 2 = Player B

Turn 3 = Player A

Turn 4 = Player B

God Charges become usable starting on turn 4.

From turn 4 onward, you may pay costs such as:

“God Code — Spend 1 God Charge: …”

“Spend 2 God Charges: Your Avatars get +3 Power this turn.”

“Spend 3 God Charges: Destroy all other Avatars.”

When you spend God Charges, remove that many counters from your Deity or God Charge track.

3. Card Types & Anatomy
3.1 Deity

Your Deity is your leader and defines your deck and starting stats.

A Deity card usually shows:

Name & title

Aspect(s) (e.g., Glow, Void, Gray)

Domain tag (e.g., “Domain: Second Sun”, “Domain: Null Depths”)

Starting Essence (your starting life total)

Base KL (starting energy input to your KL formula)

Abilities, which may include:

Passive effects

Activated abilities (costing KL, Essence, or God Charges)

A God Code (often a once-per-game, high-impact effect)

Rules:

Your Deity starts in a special Deity Zone.

You do not shuffle your Deity into your deck.

If your Deity’s Essence is reduced to 0 or less, you lose the game.

3.2 Domain

“Domain” has two related meanings:

A Domain tag on cards (e.g. “Domain: Second Sun”) that identifies their home realm.

The Domain card type itself, which represents the current field/realm in play for that player.

3.2.1 Domain Tags (Flavor & Synergy)

Cards sharing the same Domain tag belong to the same realm, temple, or world.

Many effects care about Domain tags, for example:

“Avatars with Domain: Second Sun get +1 Power.”

“Rites with Domain: Null Depths cost 1 less KL.”

Domain tags are used for synergy and deck identity.

3.2.2 Domain Cards (Field Effects)

Domain cards represent an ongoing field that buffs or modifies gameplay.

You play a Domain from your hand by paying its KL cost.

When played, it enters the Domain Zone.

Rules:

You can have only 1 active Domain at a time.

If you play a N
ew Domain while one is already in your Domain Zone:

The old Domain is sent to your Crypt (discard pile).

The new Domain becomes the active Domain in that zone.

Domains commonly:

Buff certain Aspects or Domains (e.g., “Glow units get +1 Power”).

Change KL flow (e.g., “At the start of your turn, if you control a Glow Avatar, gain +1 KL this turn.”).

Manipulate Essence (e.g., “Whenever you cast a Domain: Second Sun spell, heal 1 Essence.”).

3.3 Shards

Shards are fragments of the Shattered Sun and are your main way to ramp KL.

Rules:

Each Shard is a permanent card in your Shard Row.

By default, each Shard contributes +1 KL when you recalculate KL at the start of your turn.

Shards often carry Aspects (Glow Shard, Void Shard, etc.), which matter for other card interactions.

Shards feed into synergies such as:

“If you control 2+ Shards, you may choose both modes instead of one.”

“Sacrifice a Shard: gain 3 KL.”

3.4 Avatars

Avatars are your followers, creatures, or champions that fight in combat.

Each Avatar typically has:

A KL cost

One or more Aspects

An optional Domain tag

Power (attack strength)

Guard (defensive threshold)

Special abilities or rules text

Rules:

Avatars enter the Avatar Line (the battlefield).

They can be declared as attackers and blockers.

In combat:

They deal damage equal to their Power.

If an Avatar takes damage greater than or equal to its Guard in that combat, it is destroyed and sent to the Crypt (or to the Null Zone if an effect says “Nullify”).

Damage is tracked with counters or dice and is usually cleared at the end of the turn, unless a card specifies lasting damage.

3.5 Spells (Aspect Spells)

Spells are one-shot effects.

You cast a Spell by paying its KL cost (and any additional costs like Essence).

The Spell’s effect resolves.

Then the Spell goes to your Crypt, unless its text says otherwise.

Spells commonly:

Deal damage

Heal Essence

Draw cards

Manipulate zones (Veiled Deck, Crypt, Null Zone)

Interact with Aspects and Domains

3.6 Rites

Rites are big, ritual-style plays.

They typically have higher KL costs and may require additional costs:

Paying Essence

Sacrificing Avatars or Shards

Discarding cards

Rites create major swings:

Board wipes

Massive buffs

Big Essence/KL shifts

Strong interactions with Crypt and Null

Rules:

You cast a Rite like a Spell (paying KL and other costs).

After the Rite resolves, it goes to your Crypt, unless it says otherwise.

3.7 Relics

Relics are durable artifacts or items.

They enter and remain on the battlefield in your Relic / Support Zone.

They often provide:

Continuous buffs (e.g., “Glow Avatars you control get +1 Guard.”)

Triggers (e.g., “When you pay Essence to cast a Spell, draw a card.”)

Relics are permanents and remain until destroyed, sacrificed, or nullified by another effect.

3.8 Support / Companion

Support / Companion cards represent non-Deity allies or support structures.

Some function like utility Avatars (with Power and Guard).

Others behave more like Relics (persistent buffs, no combat stats).

Their behavior is dictated by their type line and rules text. They usually live in the Relic / Support Zone unless they are explicitly Avatars.

3.9 Tokens / Echo Avatars

Tokens and Echo Avatars are generated units.

They are usually created by Spells, Rites, or abilities (“Create a 2/2 Echo Avatar token.”).

They behave like Avatars while on the battlefield.

When a Token/Echo leaves the battlefield (dies, is sacrificed, is nullified):

It usually ceases to exist instead of going to Crypt or Null (unless a special rule says otherwise).

3.10 Essence / Resource Cards

If your card set includes dedicated Essence / Resource cards:

They still use KL as the default cost unless the card text says they also require Essence.

They usually manipulate:

Essence totals (healing, draining)

KL values (boosts, penalties)

The flow of both resources together

4. Zones & Board Layout

Each player has these zones:

Deity Area

Domain Zone

Shard Row

Avatar Line (battlefield for Avatars / Echoes)

Relic / Support Zone

Veiled Deck (draw pile)

Crypt (discard pile)

Null Zone (banished cards)

Hand

4.1 Recommended Physical Board Layout

To keep tracking easy, a player board can be laid out like this:

Top Center – Deity Panel

Deity Slot – where your Deity card sits.

Essence Track – numbered track around or near the Deity.

KL Track – numbered 0 to 31, with:

13 marked as “God Threshold”

31 marked as “KL Cap”

God Charge Track – 3 circles or gem slots labeled 0–3:

Include a reminder:
“God Charges: max 3. May only be spent after turn 3.”

Top Left – Domain Zone

A labeled box for your single active Domain.

Top Right – Relic / Support Zone

3–4 slots labeled Relic / Support.

Middle – Shards & Avatars

Shard Row directly below Deity:

A row of card slots labeled Shards.

Avatar Line below that:

A row labeled Avatars / Echoes.

Bottom Left – Veiled Deck

Zone labeled Veiled Deck.

Bottom Center – Crypt

Pile labeled Crypt (Discard).

Bottom Right – Null Zone

Pile labeled Null (Banished).

Optionally:

A shared Turn Counter for both players to make the “after turn 3” God Charge rule visually obvious.

5. Deck Construction

Default constructed format (you can customize for different modes):

Exactly 1 Deity card (outside the Veiled Deck) per player.

Veiled Deck size: 40–60 cards.

Veiled Deck may include:

Shards

Avatars

Spells

Rites

Relics

Support / Companions

Domains

Essence / Resource cards

Unless stated otherwise, you may include up to 3 copies of any non-basic card.

Token cards do not count toward deck size.

6. Game Setup

Choose Deities

Each player chooses 1 Deity.

Place Deity in the Deity Area.

Set Starting Essence & Base KL

Set your Essence to your Deity’s printed Starting Essence.

Note your Deity’s Base KL.

Choose Domain Rules

Default: Domain cards are shuffled into the Veiled Deck and must be drawn and played.

Variant: “Home Domain” – each player starts with one chosen Domain in their Domain Zone.

Build & Shuffle Veiled Deck

Build decks following the construction rules.

Shuffle and place face-down as your Veiled Decks.

Draw Starting Hands

Each player draws 7 cards.

Mulligan option (basic version):

You may shuffle your hand back into your Veiled Deck and draw 6 instead.

More detailed mulligan rules can be added later if desired.

Determine First Player

Decide randomly (coin flip, die roll, etc.).

The first player will skip the Draw Step of their first turn.

Initial KL & God Charges

At the very start (before the first turn):

You may set current KL = Base KL + Shards you begin with (usually just Base KL, since you start with no Shards on board).

Set God Charges = 0.

7. Turn Structure

Each turn consists of:

Start Phase

Main Phase 1

Combat Phase

Main Phase 2 (optional, same actions as Main Phase 1)

End Phase

After all steps:

The turn ends.

Play passes to the next player.

A global turn counter increments (used to enforce God Charge spending after turn 3).

7.1 Start Phase

In order:

Refresh / Ready Step

Ready (untap) all your exhausted permanents.

Remove “until end of turn” effects from last turn.

Draw Step

Draw 1 card from your Veiled Deck.

Exception: on the very first turn, the first player skips this draw.

KL Recalculation Step

Determine your current KL for this turn using the formula in section 2.2.1:

Base KL from Deity

+1 per Shard

static KL bonuses

start-of-turn KL modifiers

Then cap at 31.

When you recalculate KL, compare your old KL to your new KL for Threshold checks.

God Threshold Check

If this is the first time this turn your KL is 13 or more and earlier this turn it was 12 or less, you gain 1 God Charge (if you have fewer than 3).

Mark that you have used your Threshold trigger for this turn so you don’t gain another from later KL changes.

Other Start-of-turn Triggers

Resolve any abilities that say “At the start of your turn…”.

After the Start Phase, proceed to Main Phase 1.

7.2 Main Phases (1 and 2)

During your Main Phases, as long as you can afford the costs, you may:

Play Shards from your hand (they go to the Shard Row).

Play Avatars from your hand (they go to the Avatar Line).

Play Relics / Support from your hand (they go to the Relic / Support Zone).

Play Domains from your hand (they go to the Domain Zone; if a Domain is already there, it goes to your Crypt).

Cast Spells and Rites from your hand (resolve and then place into Crypt, unless they say otherwise).

Activate abilities on your permanents or Deity that require KL, Essence, or God Charges (if you are allowed to spend them yet).

General rules:

You must have enough KL to pay a card’s KL cost.

You must be able to pay any additional costs (Essence payments, sacrifices, discards).

Most plays and activations follow timing rules (e.g., many can only be used in your own Main Phase when the stack is clear, unless you define “fast” spells later).

7.3 Combat Phase

Combat is broken into:

Declare Attackers

Declare Blockers

Combat Damage

Combat Cleanup

7.3.1 Declare Attackers

The active player chooses any number of their ready Avatars to attack.

Each attacking Avatar is assigned a target, usually the opposing Deity.

Mark chosen Avatars as attacking.

7.3.2 Declare Blockers

The defending player assigns their ready Avatars as blockers.

Each Avatar can usually block one attacker (unless a card states otherwise).

An attacker may be blocked by multiple Avatars if rules or abilities allow; if so, the attacking player chooses how that attacker divides its damage among its blockers.

7.3.3 Combat Damage

Once attackers and blockers are locked in, all combat damage is dealt simultaneously:

Each attacking Avatar deals damage equal to its Power to its assigned blocker(s) or the opposing Deity if unblocked.

Each blocking Avatar deals damage equal to its Power to the attacker it blocked.

Results:

If an Avatar has damage marked on it that is greater than or equal to its Guard, it is destroyed and sent to the Crypt (or Null, if an effect replaces this).

Any unblocked attacking Avatar deals its Power as Essence damage to the defending Deity’s controller.

7.3.4 Combat Cleanup

Resolve any abilities that trigger from combat:

“When this Avatar deals combat damage…”

“When an Avatar you control dies…”

At the End Phase of the turn, remove all combat damage from any surviving Avatars (their damage is reset to 0).

7.4 End Phase

Resolve any “At end of turn…” abilities.

Clear all “until end of turn” buffs or effects.

Your current KL will be recalculated next turn; you do not carry unused KL over.

Then the turn ends and play passes to the next player.

8. Spending God Charges (Summary)

You can gain God Charges:

By crossing the 13 KL Threshold for the first time each turn.

By card effects that grant God Charges directly.

You can never hold more than 3 God Charges.

You cannot spend God Charges during turns 1–3 of the game.

Starting on turn 4, you may spend God Charges to pay for costs on Deities and other cards (e.g., God Codes and high-power abilities).

When you spend God Charges, remove that many from your Deity or God Charge tracker.

9. Winning & Losing

You win the game if:

An opponent’s Deity has 0 or less Essence, or

A card or effect explicitly says you win.

You lose the game if:

Your Deity has 0 or less Essence, or

A card or effect explicitly says you lose, or

(Optional rule) You must draw from an empty Veiled Deck and deck-out loss is enabled.

In multiplayer, if multiple players lose at the same time, they are removed from the game simultaneously; the last remaining player wins, unless a card says otherwise.

Campaign or narrative modes may alter or ignore deck-out and use custom win/loss conditions.

10. Synergies (Deckbuilding Guidance)

Essence Crown encourages building around synergies:

Domain Synergy

Cards with the same Domain tag (e.g., Second Sun, Null Depths) often buff or support each other.

Example: Second Sun may reward Glow Avatars and Essence healing; Null Depths may reward sacrifices and Null effects.

Aspect Synergy

Glow – buffs, healing, support, and swarming units.

Void – sacrifice, Essence payment, Crypt/Null manipulation.

Gray – flexible, hybrid, smoothing draws and KL.

KL Synergy

Some cards care about the amount of KL you have or spend:

“If you spent 5+ KL to cast this, draw a card.”

“Whenever you spend KL, deal that much damage among any targets.”

Essence Synergy

Some effects get stronger when you pay or lose Essence:

Rites powered by Essence payments.

Relics that trigger when you pay Essence to cast Spells.

Card Type Synergy

Relics buff Rites.

Rites power up Avatars.

Support cards enhance Deity abilities or resource flow.

Zone Synergy

Cards can interact with:

The Veiled Deck (top-of-deck manipulation).

The Crypt (reanimation, recursion).

The Null Zone (banish and retrieve).

Tokens/Echoes (summoning and swarming).

A strong deck usually picks a Deity + Domain and then stacks synergies that match its Aspects, KL pattern, Essence plan, and God Charge usage.
